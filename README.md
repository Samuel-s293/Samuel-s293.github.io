# presentation
- i really like the variation of layout you have used
- most elements are missing css but i believe you're working on it

# content
some interesting content there but i havent finished reading yet

# HTML
i have looked at some of your HTML code and it looks pretty good and valid

# collab
- i can see collab here
- but i would be nice to organise pages into folders
  - eg nathan has his folder to put all his work in or
  - eg organise into pages, ie home page has its own folder
