# Interest of Content
Very interesting content, love how much info there is going on and all the pictures 
that've been used keep the viewer. Our favourite page on our favourite website was the
one about real life applications which looked very clean (apart from the links on 
the left), the pages on gaming with Minecraft and Portal were very nostalgic, muy bien. ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸

# Consistency and Quality of Visual Presentation
There isn't much consistency but the nav bar is beautiful and consistent, makes it
really easy to get around. The quality of the visuals are very cool, we like the
iframes but we are a bit squished in, could maybe do with some padding around the
frames?

# Quality of Written Presentation
A really powerful way to share ideas, you've considered the audience of us 3 very
well and our interests.

# Validity of HTML
A few redundancies picked up by the IDE but nothing major just like an extra closing
`</li>` tag in the index.html file. A couple typos but nothing to really massively
break the website and we aren't too serious for it to matter that much. There are a
few blank files on the sidebar of hardware but that's a bit like life.

# Evidence of Collaboration
The commit tree looks active which shows lots of collaboration and 9 closed PRs
which shows working as a team and the git blame for index.html does only show
two people but overall lots of balanced collaboratiob

# Overall
We think it's a great site, I can imagine myself spending hours and hours on this
learning about new things.
